# gb-net6
A Game Boy emulator in C# / .NET 6, heavily based on https://github.com/davidwhitney/CoreBoy after realizing I forgot about timing ðŸ˜…. 

The WinForms version is running pretty smoothly, including sound, although not all of the test ROMs out there are passing and GBC support is not all there yet.
In short: there are better emulators out there if you want to play games.

But if you want to hack something together, go ahead and have fun!
